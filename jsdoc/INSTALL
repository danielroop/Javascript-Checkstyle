Drupal
======

Installing Drupal
=================

http://drupal.org/drupal-5.7 (tested on 5.7 at the time of this writing)
http://drupal.org/getting-started/5/install

Installing Libraries
====================

Read the EXTERNALS file in jsdoc/lib

Installing the Module
=====================

http://drupal.org/node/70151
Drop the jsdoc folder into sites/all/modules

Enable the Module
=================

Enable in: Administer->Site building->Modules

Configure
=========

* Fill in the configuration in: Administer->Site configuration->JavaScript Documentation
** The file should be run from the docscripts directory
** The file used to parse code is dojo.inc (in the includes directory).
** Both should be full paths
** The base is "dojo"
* Copy one of the files in docscripts/modules (dojox.module is the best) if you want to
  support your project. Function names should begin with the module name.
  eg dojo.module's functions start with "dojo"

example (strings taken from UI, indented values are example values from a real config):
	Directory to run your file from:
		/srv/www/vhosts/api-staging.dojotoolkit.org/dojo-trunk/util/docscripts
	Location of file used to parse your code:
		/srv/www/vhosts/api-staging.dojotoolkit.org/dojo-trunk/util/docscripts/includes/dojo.inc
	This will be used as a base of our functions:
		dojo
Run Cron
========

In the base of your Drupal folder, you'll see cron.php. Run this in the browser
